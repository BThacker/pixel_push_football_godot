HOW TO PLAY


MOVING | BASICS
__________________________
Touch and hold outside of the shadowed area to spawn your pointer. Drag or flick your pointer into the ball to impact and move it. Impact force and pointer offset can be adjusted in the settings menu. The practice mode is a great place to get used to the physics. 

TOUCHDOWN
__________________________
To score a touchdown you must knock the ball on top of the yellow scoring line of the opposite team. The ball must come to a rest ontop of the line.

EXTRA POINTS
__________________________
After a touchdown you can attempt a 1 point PAT or a 2 point conversion. You must kick a field goal for a PAT. For a 2 point conversion you will get one attempt from the 50 yard line to move the ball ontop of the scoring line. 

TOUCHBACK / SAFETY / STRIKEOUTS
__________________________
If you knock the ball backwards ontop of or past your own scoring line that will be a safety and the other team will be awarded 2 points and possession. If you knock the ball over the opposing scoring line without it coming to rest ontop of the line, it will be a touchback. Each touchback counts as a strike and after 3 strikes the opposing team can attempt a field goal worth 3 points.
