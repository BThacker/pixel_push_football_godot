Massively reduce APK size by multiple exports:

You should export one APK per architecture supported by Android (ARMv7, ARMv8, x86) then upload them using Google Play's multiple APK support.
x86 is optional, but ARMv7 and ARMv8 (64-bit ARM) will be required starting from August 2019. T
o do so, create several export presets, each of them having only one architecture checked (the export process will strip unused libraries from the APK).

This will make each APK much smaller as it will only contain the native library required by the user's device.
