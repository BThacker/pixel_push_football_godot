Challenge ideas
track spin of ball
have to hit random scoring locations on the field


have to score touchdowns in a row, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90 yards

2 minute warning, score as many touchdowns within 2 minutes while moving back and up the field


beat the defense
3 levels, front lineman, middle linebacker, far safety
slow, medium, fast
heavy, middle, light

field goal frenzy - dont mess with this goal post

hit the reciever


add the random tackling dummies to the 2 player mode as a unlockable game mode
