# pixel_push_football_godot
Scripts from the production version of pixel push football (android , ios) 
This code is not *good* or even well written in a lot of cases.  
What this code is, is functional. I wrote the main game in less than 5 months.  
This is a testament to how easy Godot and GDscript are to pick up, but I by no means applied 
best practices or even good practices in a lot of cases.   

With that said the game logic is very stable 
and mostly bug free. When designing a game for younger kids, accounting for literally any and every button press becomes challenging. 

This is mostly just an example of how much code can be involved in even a small game release.  


I will go back and try to add more comments and information on this code base.

# reference 
main.gd = main game controller and logic 
game_event_control.gd = giant case switch I used to try and organize common events in the game 


I had no idea how to do UI, so the menu_control.gd is ridiculous (but functional)
