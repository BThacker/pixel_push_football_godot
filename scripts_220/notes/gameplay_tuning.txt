football weight / damping
old weight 9.8
damp 2, damp 1.5


physics calculations for AI done based on ball defaults
tune touch force for player input
current touch force is .5 weight


time before sleep .25




new weight:
.25 mass on touch force
touch force drag scale 40 (makes it much more responsive on mobile)
.25 mass makes the impact take a lot of effort on mobile

bumping back up to .35
